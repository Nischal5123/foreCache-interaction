  "answer": "Would be helpful to have the size of the aircraft group so one could explore the impact of different sizes of birds on different size planes.  Does a smaller bird create the same damage on a smaller plane as a bigger one on bigger planes?  \nBig birds at dawn seem to have the highest cost of repair.  And the riskiest phase of flight is the climb.  Also, it looks like the cost is not equally distributed across states--some have much more of a problem than others.  \nIt would also be interesting to see the flight dates grouped into quarters/season as birds migrate, so that would let one know key times of the year for different areas.  There is too much data in some of the other graphs-- Airline Operator, phase of flight, and wildlife species is too large to visually take in. Would like an effect of damage, phase of flight, and wildlife species chart.\n"
