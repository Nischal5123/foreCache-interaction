  "disadv": "Functionality is limited when you can only look at visuals and no supporting statistics etc. As mentioned earlier it would be great to be able to scale and deaverage various metrics to better understand trends. For deeper analysis this tool wouldn't work but it can certainly help familiarize someone with a dataset.",
  "comment": "The clicking can be a bit janky as the cursor sometimes comes off an on. Unsure if there is any logic on the recommended charts, sometimes they are completely useless and just layer on another random metric or dimension."
