  "adv": "For general questions (like questions 3, 4, and 5), the recommendations are very useful because when I didn't have any knowledge of the dataset, I would need these recommendations to help me explore the dataset. Another advantage is that these recommendations will make my decisions less biased because I might fail to check every possible related attribute in the dataset before answering the questions. The recommendations remind me of doing it.",
  "disadv": "It would be better if more interactive features can be added to the system. For example, filter, sort, aggregate, etc. Some charts have too many records listed as rows/columns and finding a single record is a bit hard. Another disadvantage is some recommended visualization is difficult to read. For example, a circle, a rectangle and  a triangle at the same place. ",
