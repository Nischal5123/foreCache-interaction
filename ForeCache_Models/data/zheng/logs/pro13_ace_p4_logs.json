For example maybe I see a lot of drama movies are highly rated on Rotten Tomatoes but it's hard to compare that to horror or musical because the scale is different. Would be great to break it down by percentage instead of just record count. Similar to RT rating by month, definitely seems interesting that there are peaks to the highly rated movies (summer, Xmas) but hard to judge as different months have very different volumes",
