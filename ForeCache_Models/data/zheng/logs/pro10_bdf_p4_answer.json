  "answer": "I thought it was weird that dawn and dusk don't have more birdstrikes than when it is daytime. I would think it's easier for a bird to miss a big airplane when it's sunny and not changing brightness.\n\nOf course birds follow some sort of migratory pattern that can be seen in the increase of birdstrikes during Aug-Oct.\n\nAug and Sep look like they are very expensive months for Coster_Other during the dusk and night time, respectively. \n\nI'm surprised approach had a lot of strikes but was less costly to fix than the ones in the climb phase."
