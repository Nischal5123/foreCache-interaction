  "adv": "Gives you a visual way to select the combination of different variables within a visualization without you having to try them all. Instead, it seems to lay them out for you (but grouped into categories with the ability to click through them). I liked this approach. I think it can be faster to scan a bunch of visualizations for the right one rather than having to individually add variables one by one to see which one might look the best. You could probably extend this even further with different types of charts all displayed together that you can pick from.",
  "disadv": "The charts that had vertical lines were in some cases hard to see on my screen - whether it was a single line or two lines. The biggest challenge was that it was hard to get the mouse/pointer directly over the lines as they were thin to be able to see the more detailed numbers in the pop-ups. I had to give up on hovering over some of the data points because it was too hard to get the cursor right over them (this is probably not an issue with the concept, just the application and size of the lines which I'm sure could be tweaked). ",
  "comment": "I think a bunch of the time it took me to answer the questions was both figuring out what the question meant (I also had an issue at first where I had to zoom out to see all of the questions) and also learning what was possible with the tool. It's an interesting approach. I'd be interested to see where this research goes. Like I said above, I like the idea of giving people lots of visual choices to scan through rather than having to pick each variable one by one. As humans are visual, it is likely faster to pick out a chart that will work from a bunch of charts all next to each other rather than having to think of the perfect visualization in your mind and then add in variables one by one."
