  "answer": "The most frequent bird strikes occur from DFW airport -- though without knowing the total flight volume it's impossible to truly understand the frequency.\n\nMost bird strikes cause no damage.\n\nThe data appears to need to be cleaned as \"B\" and \"C\" are categories for the effect_amount_of_damage. These values are not consistent with the other entries. Similarly, 'Business' is listed as an aircraft_airline_operator -- unclear what this represents (perhaps all business-owned private jets?)\n\nBird strikes are most frequent in teh August-October timeframe, though again, without knowing the total flight volume, it's difficult to know if this is because of more birds or more flights.\n\n\n"
