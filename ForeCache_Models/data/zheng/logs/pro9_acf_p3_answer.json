  "answer": "Success can either be measured in terms of Worldwide Gross or IMDB Rating. Based on above 2 metrics, I think following movies will be successful\n\n1. They should be among the following genres:\na. Adventure\nb. Action\nc. Drama\nd. Thriller/Suspense\n\n2. They should be either an Original Screenplay or based on book/short story/comic or graphic novel or can be adaptation of a TV series. They can be based on real life events but though a higher IMDB rating is probable in this case there seems to be no guarantee of commercial success.\n\n3. Should be from following creative types:\na. Historical Fiction\nb. Science Fiction\nc. Fantasy\nd. Dramatization\ne. Contemporary Fiction\n\nI was unable to figure out the correlation between different variable from the charts. It would be more helpful if the charts are interactive."
