  "answer": "I used the #Cost_Repair visualization to identify what is considered as high repair cost and I used this diagram to decide to focus on repair costs more than 3.000.000.\n\nThen I thought that three factors are the most interesting to check: Phase of flight, size of wildlife and time of day.\n\nI explored visualization based on these factors. In the end I am not sure that the time of the day plays a role. I also checked flight_date which seems to be a better factor to explore. \n\nSo my answer is that birdstrikes that happen during Approach, Landing or Climb phases  in the months of September, Jun and February from large species seem to cost the most repair \n"
