  "answer": "Original screenplays make up the majority of movie sources. There's also more drama and comedies than action and other genres, maybe due to popularity or the budget needed. There are a lot of movies done with a lower budget, but certain genres don't go past a certain limit. Action, adventure, and thrillers have a bigger variety of production budget levels.

A lot of distributors work with different genres of movies, though some only work on a few."
