  "answer": "In Dallas there were the most incidents among all airports. It would be interesting to see the wildlife statistics here or the airport prevention actions comparing to other airports.\n\nWe also can see that in the most cases the effect of damage is none. Overall, we can see that the effect of damage is uniform across all airports. However, the most incidents happend with American Airlines operator, which is unexpected (I would assume that it also would be uniform or depend on the number of flights). \n\nThe highiest number of incidents happened with Boing737-300 and with southwest company and with MD-models used for American airlines."
