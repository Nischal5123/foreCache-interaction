  "adv": "This tool does make it relatively straightforward to summarize data by different categories and measures. Being able to hover over a data point to see the value is helpful.",
  "disadv": "The chart types displayed are very limited and seem to be focused on representing the data as different sizes of circles -- instead of more traditional lines & charts. There did not appear to be any way to filter the data, so you were left with a \"guess and check\" method of trying to investigate any particular insight. There was no way to control for the single chart you wanted to generate, and were often left with sub-optimal ways of trying to answer specific questions. The loading performance of the visualizations was very slow -- often with the primary chart rendering after the secondary charts -- I would expect this to be the other way around. ",
  "comment": "Almost all the recommended charts used color inappropriately -- often picking categories to represent color where there were so many colors as to make them all meaningless. Similarly, the recommended charts were often all featuring circles across very large plots, making it difficult to visually interpret the results. On many occasions, the user had to scroll to see the entire chart, making it nearly impossible to understand the entire visualization."
