  "adv": "One advantage was the visualizer selected the representation for me based on where the data was numerical, categorical; or if aggregated, the bin size, counts. Another advantage was the related views included fields which I would not have thought to be relevant, but could be relevant to a different study or a new perspective on data.",
  "disadv": "One disadvantage was some data fields, such as distributor, had too many categorical elements to be useful in visualization. Too many directors and too many producers make it difficult to see any meaningful trends. Another disadvantage is using circles to represent counts and values is sometimes difficult to interpret when two circles are used at the same time to represent numerical features, like counts and dollar amounts. \n",
  "comment": "The recommendation system for visualization is nice because it can infer the data type and produce visualizations very quickly without having to think too much about how the data should \"look\".  The downside is that if the same look is used for multiple features it can be confusing to the user.  I did like how I could click the list button to bring up similar visualizations using different fields which I may not have considered initially.  "
