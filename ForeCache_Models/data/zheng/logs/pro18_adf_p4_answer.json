This could be better than bookmarks in that you can keep your own feed curated this way and not need to maintain bookmarks.\n\nSome vizzes, like Title, crowd the text so much that they become illegible.\n\nThe x-axis should always be visible but instead often requires scrolling to see what's being represented."
