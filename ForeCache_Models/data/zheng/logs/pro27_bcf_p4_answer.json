  "answer": "Some interesting insight that I found was that for some reason American Airlines seems to be the airline that has reported the most amount of bird strikes. Furthermore, if a bird strike were to happen, chances are that a small or medium bird would most likely be the cause of the strike.  \n\nIf a large bird were to cause a strike on the airplane, then chances are that the strike could be an expensive one to repair. The strike would more likely be more expensive if the plane was hit in either the approach or climb phase of flight. "
