  "answer": "As I mentioned in last task, it would be very beneficial if charts are interactive.  Following things will be very useful:\n1. Zooming in and out on specific ranges of continuous variables\n2. Changing the axes or even enlarging the graph if something is not clearly visible\n\n\nFurther, I think there are some visualizations which are buggy or are counter-intuitive. For example in IMDB-Rating vs Worldwide Gross, I just saw a big circle on top right corner. It seems like everything was clubbed in the same bucket. In other cases, when we are plotting graphs on 3 variables, a multi-colored approach would be much easier to visualize rather than density of the stroke.\n\nThere is a chart that I have bookmarked - IMDB Rating vs Production Budget vs Worldwide Gross. Can't make anything out of it. I think we needed colors.\n\n"
