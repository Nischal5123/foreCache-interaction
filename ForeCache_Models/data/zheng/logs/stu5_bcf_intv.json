  "adv": "Great at creating good looking graphs for displaying 2 variables. ",
  "disadv": "When 3 variables are used the data can be too far spaced out to understand properly OR it can be to close together where the bubbles start to overlap and you can not properly see whats there anymore.",
  "comment": "I would suggest adding \"total\" and \"average\" to the graphs that have many bubbles overlapping eachother. You can already see the variables show up when you hover over the data points so adding a total number would be useful for when many bubbles overlap eachother.\n\nAlso the option to see all of the bubbles values when hovering over a spot that overlaps."
