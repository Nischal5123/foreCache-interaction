  "answer": "It seems that there is a relationship between the aircraft speed and the repair cost. From about 125 knots- 200 knots with larger birds, there seems to be a much larger cost. Faster than that it seems the cost goes down, perhaps because the bird experiences more damage than the plane -- not sure. \n\nI wish there was a way to enable/ disable only certain items such as just compare approach, climb and take-off turn or select only one aircraft make model. That would have made it a bit easier for me to look at the data more carefully."
