  "answer": "I believe that action/adventure movies, distributed by 20th century fox and released in the summer would be the most successful. Additionally, if they are fantasy or sci-fi movies they will perform better. I am measuring performance in terms of Worldwide Gross and US Gross. From my observations, it seems that the most important characteristics to predicting success are creative type, release date and genre. I think the distributor helps but only if it is already a good movie. "
