  "adv": "It saves a lot of time for initial exploratory data analysis and gives a good overview of the data.\nIt has a very intuitive and acessible interface.\nIt seems to be fast.",
  "disadv": "The plot sizes are not adjustable, making it hard to find some data points.\nIt is quite limited in functions.\nSome plots become very crowded and hard to read, but I believe this is also a flaw of not being able to resize the plot.\nIt doesn't support more filtering of the data inside a column (for example exhibiting data only on large wildlife air accidents).\nShould include a correlation matrix, probably.",
  "comment": "I feel like it has a lot of potential and is a great idea, just needs more polishing and perhaps to be a little more robust in features. I really enjoyed it and would've been a great asset in many projects."
