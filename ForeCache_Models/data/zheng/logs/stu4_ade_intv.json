  "adv": "It automatically generates various types of graphs based on the data type. Automatically generate graphs when selecting the fields is very helpful.",
  "disadv": "Some of the graphs are hard to understand. For example, I don't really understand any graph related to three fields when creative_type is included. I guess the ability to summarize some data is crucial here.",
  "comment": "I think the ability to generate graphs for selected fields are way more useful than the related view. Finding the interested graph takes too much time comparing to re-selecting the interested fields.\nAlso, I think rather than suggest related graphs, automatically computing the sum or mean of some data may be more interesting and helpful."
