This is difficult for our eyes to compare the length of the bars. I would have preferred to have them dodged. I also did not like that I couldn't decide which variable went on which axis or which variable to designate the color to. There was no way to subset the data. For example, when looking at director information, the length of the bars were overshadowed by the nulls.",
  "comment": "I wonder if the related plots were too distracting from the variables I was directly interested in. There was a lot to look at when there were multiple recommended charts within my view."
