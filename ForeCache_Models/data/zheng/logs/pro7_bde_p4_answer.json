  "answer": "Thought it was interesting to see which airports have the most bird strikes (may want to avoid them!).\n\nIt looks like here are the top 3:\n1. Dallas Ft. Worth\n2. Barksdale Air Force Base (wont be going)\n3. Chicago O'Hare\n\nI also thought it was interesting that the time of day you are most likely to experience a birds strike is:\n1. Day\n2. Night\n(not dusk or dawn)\n\n\nAlso interesting that the month with the highest bird strikes is:\n1. October\n\nAnd also interesting that the month/day combo to avoid is:\n1. Day in August\n2. Day in July\n3. Night in October"
