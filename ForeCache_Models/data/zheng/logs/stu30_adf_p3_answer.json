  "answer": "Basing off a Book/Short Story or using an Original Screenplay leads to success. While, overall, the summer months and the last two months of the year is a good time to release,  movies based off of Books/Short Stories are much better off released then than other times of the year. Keeping the movies between PG and PG-13 also seems to help at making it successful across all genres."
