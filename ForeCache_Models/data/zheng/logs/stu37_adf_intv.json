  "adv": "- may quickly see patterns from related views that you wouldn't have thought to create plots for\n- good for quick exploratory data analysis",
  "disadv": "- no sorting/filtering options\n- can't specify dimension/axis order\n- can't specify plot type (box+whisker would have been helpful for tasks)\n- size too small or not scaled correctly for some larger plots",
  "comment": "the recommendation system would have been much more helpful if sorting/filtering/axis-order/plot-type was allowed to change; sometimes I see possible interesting insights/trends being recommended, but the figures are too hard to read"
