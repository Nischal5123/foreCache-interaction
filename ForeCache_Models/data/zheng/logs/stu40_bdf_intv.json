  "adv": "- Love the automatic visualizations and grouping of data with the axes picked optimally\n- Loved how the system updated relatively quickly\n",
  "disadv": "- The related views simply seems like a permutation of all other parameters so it is not clear to me how well this would scale\n- The charts were static (I could not interact with it other than hover and read the values) -- I wish I could dig deeper by clicking on each item or filtering to less number of items or disable items with zero values\n- The related views is a good idea, however, it was not clear how helpful it was. I found myself trying to use the menu option on the  left to find my own combinations than using the related views.",
  "comment": "I like the idea of related views a lot. But at least for the flight collision data and the questions that were raised, the tool was not as helpful for me.\n\nI am curious as to what kind of effort is required in setting up the database to start doing some visualizations and analysis. I would have been also interested in that part to be able to evaluate if I would use this tool for my own dataset. If set up is much easier, then trying it out is also much easier before I decide if this tool is useful or not. Just by using the preconfigured dataset it is difficult for me to evaluate.\n\nGood luck with the rest of the study. Hopefully, I am an exception and others find it more useful than me."
