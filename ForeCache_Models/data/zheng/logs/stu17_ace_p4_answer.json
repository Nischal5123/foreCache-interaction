  "answer": "Original screenplays on science fiction have been the most financially successful films. This makes sense given the success of films like Star Wars and Back to the Future, but is still interesting to note for film-makers.\n\n20th century Fox has been the distributors of the most successful films with original screenplays.\n\nContemporary fiction movies are the most common or mainstream (highest count of records) but they are also the kind of movies that are mostly rated PG-13 or R. These movies are also the most financially successful among all creative types."
