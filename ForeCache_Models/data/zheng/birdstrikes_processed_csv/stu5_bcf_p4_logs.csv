typed in answer,"When loading graphs with more then two variables, the generation was significantly slowed down.

The use of color coded bubbles made reading the graphs harder to do since the change in colors was not very significant and so they easily blended together when the graphs contained a lot of data to represent.

Sometimes the color coded bubbles were useful, in the graph using  (Airport_Name, When_Phase_of_flight, Wildlife_Size) There is an obvious note to make that large wildlife is less common for impacts since most of the view is taken up by medium and small wildLife_Size.

The graphs were most useful when only two variables were shown Which makes sense.

I would suggest though for when lots of bubbles are overlapped such as the graph of (Flight_Date ,Speed_IAS_in_knots ,When_Phase_of_flight
) that there be a totaling and averaging box that shows up when moving the mouse over them since they already show the variables values in a table which is a very nice feature. So the addition of the totaling of all the circles in the spot would be useful because depending on how your mouse is positioned would change what info you see because of the significant overlapping going on.
