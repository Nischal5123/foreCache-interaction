I want to find the airport with highest total cost, however, this tool cannot do the summation automatically and by hand.

2. Which month/Season has the most records？ Autumn. Spring is the second.

3. Which species has the most record? From the chart, it's not that clear. Since most bird is unknown bird. So this lead me to check bird size.  Small birds causes most records.

4. What size of the bird cause the most total cost? Can't know from the chart. the data point is dimensional. I hope this tool can sum them up.
