typed in answer,"- It is interesting to see that the majority of the movies that are produced are contemporary fiction (I had not thought about this before). 
- There is missing Director information for so many records that this skewed the data set of all the others - they are too small to show on the chart (I wish I had a way to exclude this null, for example, to give me a better perspective of the rest of the directors)
- Action movies are the major genre of the highest US Gross and Worldwide gross movies.
- Majority of Adventure genre movies are released in the month of May",1602858308435
