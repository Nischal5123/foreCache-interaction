typed in answer,"As I mentioned in last task, it would be very beneficial if charts are interactive.  Following things will be very useful:
1. Zooming in and out on specific ranges of continuous variables
2. Changing the axes or even enlarging the graph if something is not clearly visible


Further, I think there are some visualizations which are buggy or are counter-intuitive. For example in IMDB-Rating vs Worldwide Gross, I just saw a big circle on top right corner. It seems like everything was clubbed in the same bucket. In other cases, when we are plotting graphs on 3 variables, a multi-colored approach would be much easier to visualize rather than density of the stroke.
